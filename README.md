# Tourism and Economy

This repository contains the final project for the *Intro. to Data Science and Engineering* course.  
The project explores the relationship between **tourism** and **economic indicators**, analyzing data to understand the potential correlations and patterns.

## ðŸ“Š Project Description
The project investigates how tourism impacts a country's economy by leveraging datasets involving tourist arrivals, GDP growth, and other related metrics.

We performed the following steps:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of trends
- Correlation analysis
- Model building and evaluation

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings
- Positive correlation observed between tourism and GDP growth in several countries.
- Seasonal tourism trends show significant impact on quarterly economic data.
- Machine learning models show potential in forecasting tourism-based economic indicators.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To run the notebook:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `project.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Install the required libraries listed in the notebook cells if necessary.
